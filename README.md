🛰️ Polarization and Absorption in Multifunctional Metasurfaces
Research Internship Project | National Institute of Technology Patna

📌 Overview
This project focuses on the design and simulation of a low-profile multifunctional metasurface capable of both absorbing electromagnetic (EM) waves and achieving polarization conversion (circular and cross-polarization). The work was conducted during a research internship at NIT Patna under the guidance of faculty members from the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering.

🎯 Objectives
Design a metasurface for enhanced EM wave absorption.

Enable circular polarization and cross-polarization functionalities across specific frequency bands.

Simulate the structure using CST Microwave Studio to evaluate performance and optimize results.

Prepare findings for academic publication.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies
CST Microwave Studio – Electromagnetic simulation

Rogers RT5880 – Substrate used in structural modeling

Copper Patterns – For defining surface behavior

Scientific Literature & Research Papers – For reference and benchmarking

📈 Key Results
Achieved ~100% absorption in targeted EM spectrum bands.

Enabled circular polarization with effective ellipticity in the Ku and K-band range.

Demonstrated cross-polarization conversion with high PCR (Polarization Conversion Ratio).

Simulated complex patterns like split ring resonators and geometric cuts to control EM behavior.

Results are part of an upcoming journal publication.

👨‍💻 My Role
Designed and modeled metasurface structures from scratch.

Conducted parameter sweeps and optimized performance.

Analyzed simulation outputs for axial ratio, polarization conversion, and absorption rates.

Collaborated on the research paper drafting and result interpretation.

📚 Outcome
This internship helped me gain deep insights into electromagnetic theory, simulation tools, and scientific research methodology. It also contributed to an academic paper currently under review.
